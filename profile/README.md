Unblocked Games 76 websites are built using **HTML5** and **JavaScript**, meaning every game runs directly inside your web browser. No Flash Player, no installation, no plugins. You just visit the site, click on the game you want, and start playing instantly.

This technology ensures that:

* They work across multiple devices — PC, Mac, Chromebook, or tablet.
* They bypass many standard network restrictions safely.

For example, on **edujojo.space**, each game opens in its own iframe, designed to look clean and distraction-free. Ads are placed strategically so they don’t interfere with gameplay, and each game page includes SEO-friendly descriptions and “How to Play” sections.
